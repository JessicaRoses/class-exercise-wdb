	<h2>A Successful Website</h2>
		<p>Besides having amazing advertising, <a href="https://casper.com"> Casper's website</a> is a pleasure to navigate and conducive to promoting all of their products. Starting with the clearly labeled headers “mattress”, “pillow”, “sheets”, and “more” are easy to find at the top of the page and travel with you as you scroll down the home page for more information. Having clear titles makes this an efficient element of the website. Having an option to observe reviews of their product at the top gives the consumer confidence that they are proud enough of their reviews to be on the same level of importance as the other headers. The home page is broken up with visual elements incorporating subtle animations when you hover over an element. Thus making it a satisfying experience to navigate through the various bits of information. I found no errors of broken links or incorrect product linkage. </p>

		<p>Casper’s main product is mattresses; recently they unveiled a new type of mattress that is more expensive than their original. They have a drop down option under the “mattress” header that allows you to compare and contrast each mattress in order to make the most educated purchase. Their consistent visual theme and organization of information throughout the website makes memorability easy. Not having a clearly defined search bar is the biggest user design flaw with Casper’s website. Also their frequently asked question section is nested in with their product purchase pages. I don’t feel this is necessarily an intuitive place to find the FAQ, but the memorability factor of this is successful. In conclusion this beautifully constructed and detail oriented website is a great reflection of Casper’s brand architecture and ultimately their products.</p>

	<h2>A Less Successful Website</h2>
			<p>The design of the <a href="http://halloween-nyc.com">Village Halloween Parade's website</a> is extremely unsatisfactory to use. Many elements of the home page are blurry and not high resolution- this includes photographs and other graphic element buttons. There is a broken link right under the rotating slideshow of pictures “2016 photo galleries are HERE” that leads to an empty page. Under the heading “March IN the 2017 Parade!” there is far too much variation in the text with capitalization and bolding with no regard for a hierarchy of information. This makes it confusing for users to understand what the important facts to take away from the paragraph. At the bottom of the home page, there are two turquoise boxes, one is a quote and the other is a call to donate. The call to donate gets lost because it is below the quote, especially since these elements look like buttons that are able to be clicked to go to a different page although they are not interactive. </p>

			<p>Overall, the usability is confusing because there are so many different options of buttons to click on the right hand side in addition to the headers that also direct you to different pages. In conclusion this site is confusing to use and extremely hideous to look at and engage with. The user experience of the website reflects an idea that New York’s Village Halloween Parade as a sub-par, unorganized event.</p>
