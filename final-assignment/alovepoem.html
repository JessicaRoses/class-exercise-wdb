all the women 
all their kisses the 
different ways they love and 
talk and need. 

their ears they all have
ears and 
throats and dresses 
and shoes and 
automobiles and ex-
husbands. 

mostly
the women are very 
warm they remind me of 
buttered toast with the butter 
melted 
in. 

there is a look in the 
eye: they have been 
taken they have been
tooled. I don’t know quite what to 
do for 
them. 

I am
a fair cook a good
listener 
but I never learned to 
dance - I was busy 
then with larger things. 

but I’ve enjoyed their different 
beds 
smoking cigarettes
staring at the 
ceilings. I was neither vicious nor 
unfair. Only 
a student. 

I know they all have these 
feet and barefoot they go across the floor as
I watch their bashful buttocks in the 
dark. I know that they like me, some even
love me 
but I love very 
few. 

some give me oranges and vitamin pills;
others talk quietly of 
childhood and fathers and 
landscapes; some are almost 
crazy but none of them are without 
meaning; some love
well, others not
so; the best at sex are not always the 
best in other 
ways; each has limits as I have 
limits and we learn 
each other 
quickly. 

all the women all the 
women all the 
bedrooms
the rugs the 
photos the 
curtains, it’s 
something like a church only 
at times there’s 
laughter. 

those ears those 
arms those
elbows those eyes
looking, the fondness and 
the wanting I have been
held I have been 
held.
