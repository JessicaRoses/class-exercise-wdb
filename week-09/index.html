        For my final site project I will be pursuing option one of adapting an already existing narrative. I am particularly inspired by <a href="http://jessandruss.us" target="_blank">Jess and Russ’s</a> wedding RSVP. Traditionally I am not a fan of attending weddings, as all the ones I have been to have been boring. However I would go to their wedding based on the pure fact of how awe-inspiringly beautiful their website is. Also <a href="https://madebyfew.com" target="_blank">Made by Few's</a> website filled with quirky illustrations and fun subtle button interactions. My favorite writer and poet is Charles Bukowski. I want to dissect selections of his poems into an interactive site similar to Jess and Russ’s. I hope to use typography, imagery, interactive elements, and sound to emphasize various parts of the texts.

        I plan to examine poems “People as Flowers”, “A Love Poem”, “Scene from 1940”, “When You Wait For The Dawn To Crawl Through The Screen Like A Burglar To Take Your Life Away”, “The Girls and the Birds”, “For Jane: with all the love I had, which was not enough:”, “Van Gogh”, “Beagle”, “A Love Poem”, and a quote from his novel “Factotum”
